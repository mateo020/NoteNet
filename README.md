# NoteNet
## Knowledge Graph Generation for Better Learning

---

## The Problem
Students face several challenges when it comes to understanding complex concepts and relationships between ideas:
- Traditional note-taking methods fail to capture the connections between information.
- Limited accessibility for learners with different needs or economic situations.
- Text-heavy content can be overwhelming and difficult to process for many learners.
